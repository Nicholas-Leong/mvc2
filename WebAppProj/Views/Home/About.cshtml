        goal is to address social responsibility and food sustainability by connecting food providers, such as
        restaurants, grocery stores, and farms, with organizations and individuals in need of food assistance. The
        project emphasizes sustainability by reducing food waste and promoting the use of locally sourced and
        environmentally friendly food options.<br /><br />

        expiration dates. They can also include information about the sourcing practices and sustainability efforts
        related to the food.<br /><br />

        listings and request the items they require. They can also specify any dietary restrictions or preferences.<br /><br />
