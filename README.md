## Goal Within our lives, we will eradicate hunger and food waste.

Mission ##
Instantly feed those in need by connecting businesses with leftover edible food.

## Summary
With the help of our platform, businesses and organisations can quickly reduce poverty and food waste by streamlining the recovery and distribution of food. By successfully recovering the extra food from weddings, parties, restaurants, and temples and redeploying food resources in an appropriate manner, the application aids in reducing food waste.

By bringing people together and making sure that the food that is left over can be delivered to those in need of food through reputable local partners, we hope to bridge the gap between these situations.
